## Introduction

This research focuses on the acoustic emissions generated when two copper spheres collide. The modeling process begins with the physics of the collision, transitions through the resulting vibrations, and concludes with the conversion of those vibrations into sound waves.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`

### Installation

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/CollisionAcoustics.git`
2. Navigate to the cloned directory: `cd CollisionAcoustics`
3. Install required Python libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

Each script corresponds to a specific segment of the research. Please refer to individual script comments or associated report sections for detailed explanations and usage instructions.
